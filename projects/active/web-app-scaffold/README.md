## Overview
Implementation of the Substack2Markdown Web App. This project will deliver a FastAPI backend with Celery workers, scraping modules for public and premium Substack posts, packaging utilities, and a minimal Next.js frontend for submitting jobs and downloading the resulting ZIP archive.

## Quick Start
_Work in progress._ Development will ultimately use `docker compose -f docker/compose.dev.yml up` to launch Redis, the API, and worker services.
